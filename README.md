# CSS Blur Filter Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the CSS `filter: blur()` property doesn't apply correctly to a specific element. The blur effect is either completely absent or only partially visible, even though the CSS code appears correct and there are no obvious conflicts with other styles.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a potential solution to this issue.

## Problem

The blur effect is not working on the element with the id `myElement`, despite setting a blur radius.

## Solution

The solution might involve checking for conflicting CSS rules, ensuring the element is correctly rendered and visible, or using vendor prefixes for broader browser compatibility.
